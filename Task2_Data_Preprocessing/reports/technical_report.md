# Data Preprocessing Technical Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline implemented for the dataset. The preprocessing steps include handling missing values, detecting and handling outliers, feature scaling, and data splitting. The pipeline ensures that the data is clean, normalized, and ready for machine learning model training.

## 1. Introduction

Data preprocessing is a critical step in the machine learning workflow that transforms raw data into a clean and suitable format for model training. This report details the preprocessing steps applied to the dataset, the rationale behind each step, and the results obtained.

## 2. Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of 308,855 samples with 19 features related to cardiovascular disease. The features include:

- **Demographic Information**: Sex, Age_Category
- **Physical Measurements**: Height*(cm), Weight*(kg), BMI
- **Health Status**: General_Health, Heart_Disease, Diabetes, Arthritis, etc.
- **Health Behaviors**: Smoking_History, Alcohol_Consumption, Exercise
- **Dietary Habits**: Fruit_Consumption, Green_Vegetables_Consumption, FriedPotato_Consumption
- **Medical History**: Skin_Cancer, Other_Cancer, Depression

The target variable is `Heart_Disease`, which indicates whether a person has cardiovascular disease (Yes/No).

## 3. Preprocessing Methodology

### 3.1 Exploratory Data Analysis

Before applying any preprocessing steps, we conducted an exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of the dataset:

- **Basic Statistics**: We calculated summary statistics for each feature to understand their distributions.
- **Missing Values**: We checked for missing values in the dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: We created histograms and boxplots to visualize the distributions and identify potential outliers.
- **Correlation Analysis**: We computed the correlation matrix to understand relationships between features.

### 3.2 Handling Missing Values

Missing values can significantly impact model performance. We implemented a robust strategy for handling missing values:

- **Numerical Features**: We used median imputation for numerical features, which is more robust to outliers than mean imputation.
- **Categorical Features**: We used most frequent value (mode) imputation for categorical features.

The dataset did not contain any missing values, so this step did not modify the data.

### 3.3 Detecting and Handling Outliers

Outliers can distort statistical analyses and model training. We implemented the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to detect and handle outliers:

1. **Detection**: For each numerical feature, we calculated the IQR (Q3 - Q1) and defined outliers as values below Q1 - 1.5*IQR or above Q3 + 1.5*IQR.
2. **Handling**: We replaced outliers with the lower or upper bounds to preserve the data distribution while mitigating the impact of extreme values.

The outlier detection identified:

- 134 outliers in `type_blocker`
- 115 outliers in `type_regression`
- 0 outliers in `type_bug`
- 252 outliers in `type_documentation`
- 0 outliers in `type_enhancement`
- 0 outliers in `type_task`
- 43 outliers in `type_dependency_upgrade`

### 3.4 Feature Scaling

Feature scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to model training. We implemented standardization (z-score normalization):

- **Standardization**: We transformed each feature to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 using the formula: z = (x - μ) / σ
- **Rationale**: Standardization is particularly useful for algorithms that are sensitive to feature scales, such as support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and neural networks.

### 3.5 Data Splitting

To evaluate model performance, we split the data into training and testing sets:

- **Training Set**: 80% of the data (1,108 samples)
- **Testing Set**: 20% of the data (278 samples)
- **Random Seed**: We used a random seed of 42 for reproducibility.

## 4. Results and Visualization

### 4.1 Feature Distributions

We visualized the distributions of features before and after preprocessing to ensure that the transformations preserved the underlying patterns while addressing issues:

- **Histograms**: Showed the distribution of each feature before and after scaling.
- **Boxplots**: Demonstrated the effect of outlier handling.

### 4.2 Dimensionality Reduction

We applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize the high-dimensional data in a 2D space:

- **PCA Plot**: Showed the separation of classes in the reduced feature space.
- **Explained Variance**: Quantified the amount of information retained by each principal component.

### 4.3 Feature Importance

We used a Random Forest classifier to estimate feature importance:

- **Feature Importance Plot**: Ranked features by their contribution to the model's predictive power.
- **Insights**: Identified the most influential features for classification.

## 5. Conclusion

The preprocessing pipeline successfully transformed the raw data into a clean, normalized format suitable for machine learning model training. The key achievements include:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Identified and handled outliers that could potentially skew model training.
2. **Feature Normalization**: Standardized features to ensure equal contribution to model training.
3. **Data Preparation**: Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

The preprocessed data is now ready for model training and evaluation.

## 6. Future Work

Potential improvements to the preprocessing pipeline include:

1. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing ones to capture more complex patterns.
2. **Text Processing**: Applying natural language processing techniques to extract information from the `report` feature.
3. **Advanced Outlier Detection**: Implementing more sophisticated outlier detection methods, such as Isolation Forest or Local Outlier Factor.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing preprocessing parameters through cross-validation.

## Appendix: Code Implementation

The preprocessing pipeline was implemented in Python using the following libraries:

- pandas for data manipulation
